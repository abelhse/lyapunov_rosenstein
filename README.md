Python implementation of Rosenstein's algorithm: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/016727899390009P .

The algorithm aims to estimate the largest Lyapunov exponent of a dynamical system by reconstructing its attractor from a single time series and analyzing the divergence of nearby trajectories.
